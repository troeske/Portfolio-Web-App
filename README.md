# Portfolio Site
This is the web app to showcase the portfolio and resume of developers, UX/UI designers and consultants in general: [MY PORTFOLIO](xxxx).

I was inspired to implement this web app to help developers (e.g. me), UX/UI designers and consultants showcase their ever evolving experience in an easy to maintain way. As it is the nature of what we do, every day will expand our skills and experience and our public available portfolio should reflect that. This puts the need for easy editing and extending on the forefront of a portfolio site. 

In addition it is also in the nature of what we do, that some projects we work on are confidential. Thus this web app provides for a controlled log-in to be able to showcase confidential projects after registration and approval. 

I will use this web app to implement my resume and portfolio of projects.
